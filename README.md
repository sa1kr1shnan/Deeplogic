Part 2: Template Creation for Data Extraction
Approach:

Developed a Python script to generate a JSON template for data extraction.
Used nested dictionaries to represent the structure of the invoice.
Included rules for extracting both header information and table data.

Challenges:

Balancing specificity of rules with flexibility to handle variations.
Representing complex table structures in JSON format.

Solution:

Implemented flexible regex-based rules for key fields.
Used a hierarchical structure in the JSON to represent different sections of the invoice.
Included fallback rules for fields that might have multiple representations.
